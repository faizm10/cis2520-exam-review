## Assignment Overview
This assignment consists of two main components involving binary expression trees and heaps.

### Q1: Binary Expression Tree
Developed a program to parse a fully parenthesized arithmetic expression involving binary operators (+, -, *, /) and construct a binary expression tree. The program takes input as a command-line argument and supports traversal options (preorder, inorder, postorder). Additionally, it evaluates the expression while handling errors like divide-by-zero and provides a calculated result in two decimal precision.

### Q2: MAX-HEAP Implementation
Implemented a program to read integers from a file ("f.dat") into a 2D array and create a MAX-HEAP. The heap is organized using a parental node downheap algorithm, with the sum of the first three integers of each row as the key. The resulting heap is displayed as a 20x10 array.

## Resources
