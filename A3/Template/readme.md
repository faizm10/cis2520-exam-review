## Student Details
- **Name**: Faiz Mustansar  
- **Student Number**: 1261489  

## Assignment Overview
This assignment has three main parts:

### **Part 1: Binary Expression Tree**
- Write a program to convert a fully parenthesized arithmetic expression into a binary expression tree.
- Supports operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`.
- Program Features:
  - Print the tree in **Preorder**, **Inorder**, or **Postorder**.
  - Evaluate the expression, detecting errors (e.g., divide by zero).
  - Handle variables and prompt users for their values if needed.

### **Part 2: Max-Heap Construction**
- Read 200 two-digit integers from a file (`f.dat`) into a 20x10 array.
- Treat each row as an object:
  - **Key**: Sum of the first 3 integers.
  - **Info**: Remaining 7 integers.
- Build a max-heap using the **parental downheap algorithm**.
- Display the heap as a 20x10 array.
