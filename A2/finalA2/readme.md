## Assignment Overview
This assignment consists of two main components involving the use of linked lists and stack-based operations:

# Q1: Rental Car Linked Lists
Implement a program to manage a car rental system using multiple linked lists for available cars, rented cars, and cars in repair. The program allows for adding cars, transferring between lists, and calculating rental charges.

# Q2: Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) Evaluation
Developed a program to evaluate postfix expressions (RPN) using a stack implemented with linked lists. The program supports basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) and prints results with two decimal precision.
