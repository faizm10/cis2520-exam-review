## Study Topics by Week

### Week 1: [**C Programming Review**](./week1-Creview)
- Overview of C programming concepts important for DSA:
  - **Storage Classes**: `auto`, `static`, `extern`, `register`.
  - **Pointers**: How they work, common use cases, and examples.
  - **Function Arguments**:
    - Call by Value
    - Call by Reference (using pointers).
  - **Best Practices**:
    - Avoid modifying loop variables inside loops.
    - Use `break` and `continue` instead of `goto`.
  - **Working with Arrays**:
    - Pointers and arrays.
    - Character arrays and strings.

### Week 2: [**Algorithm Complexity and Sorting**](./week2-complexity)
- What is an algorithm?
- How to analyze algorithms:
  - Best case, worst case, and average case.ÃŸ
  - How input size affects performance.
- **Big-O, Omega, and Theta Notations**.
- Sorting algorithms:
  - Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort.
- Summary of sorting algorithm complexities.

### Week 3: [**Linked List (SLL and DLL)**](./week3-linkedlist)

### Week 4: [**Stacks**](./week3-stacks)

## Contributing

Want to help improve this repository? Hereâ€™s how:
```
git checkout -b {your-name/feature}
git add .
git commit -m "New Feature"
git push --set-upstream origin '{your-name/feature}'
git checkout main

```

REPLACE `{your-name/feature}` with your name and the feature you're adding! If it's not your first commit, use `git push` rather than `git push --set-upstream origin {your-name/feature}`

Then head over to the GitHub repo online and create a pull request from the branch you just created.
