## Trees

### What is a tree?

- It is a abstract model of a hierarchical structure which contains nodes and edges with a parent-child relation
- datatype can be any (e.g strings, numbers, etc)
- Some of the real life applications include:
    - Organization Charts
    - File Systems
    - Decision Process
    - etc 

### Binary Tree

- In a linked list, each node has up to one successor. In a binary tree, each node has up to two children, known as a **left** child and a **right** child. *Binary* means two, referring to the two children. Some more definitions related to a binary tree:

    - **Leaf**: A tree node with no children.
    - **Internal node**: A node with at least one child.
    - **Root**: The one tree node with no parent (the "top" node). If the root has no children, and therefore is the tree's only node, the root is a leaf. Otherwise the root is an internal node.
    - **Degree** of a node: number of children that a node has
    - **Parent**: A node with a child is that child's parent.
    - A node's **ancestors** include the node's parent, the parent's parent, etc., up to the tree's root.
    - A node's **descendants** include the node's children, the childrens' children, etc.
    - **Edge**: the line connecting a node to any of its successors.
    - **Path**: A sequence of consecutive edges.
    - **Depth**: the length of the path from the root to anode n.
        - The depth of the root node is zero.
    - **Height** of a tree: total number of nodes on the path from the root node to the deepest node in the tree.
        â€“ A tree with only a root node has a height of 0

- This may seem a lot of definitions coming rihght at ya but don't worry, we will break it down with some visuals along the way!

- Let's answer some questions for the image below:
    - Root Node: **Jones**
    - Smith's Left Child: **Kumar**
    - How Many Leaf Nodes? **4 Leaf Nodes**
        - Who?? **Kumar, Lee, Gong and Carvey**
    - How Many Internal Nodes? **4 Internal Nodes (Remeber that any node with a child is an internal node)**
        - Who?? **Jones, Smith, Adams and Gupta**
    - The tree has an internal node, Gupta, with only one child rather than two. Is the tree still a binary tree? **YES!!! In a binary tree, each node has up to two children. So the tree is still a binary tree.**
    - Gupta's ancestors are _____. **Adams and Jones**
        - How? **Ancestors are determined by starting at a node's parent and then continuously going up to the next parent until reaching the root. Doing so for Gupta visits only two nodes: Adams and Jones.**
    - The descendants of Adams are _____. **Gong, Gupta and Carvey**
        - How? **Descendants are determined by starting at a node's children and then continuing down to the leaves. Doing so for Adams visits three nodes: Gong, Gupta, and Carvey.**

### Special types of Binary Trees

- Certain binary tree structures can affect the speed of operations on the tree. The following describe special types of binary trees:
    - A binary tree is **full** if every node contains 0 or 2 children.
    - A binary tree is **complete** if all levels, except possibly the last level, contain all possible nodes and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible.
    - A binary tree is **perfect** if all internal nodes have 2 children and all leaf nodes are at the same level.

### Subtree

- A binary tree subtree is any node X in the tree and all of X's descendants. Node X is the subtree's root, and the subtree itself is a valid binary tree.

### Binary Tree Representation

- **Linked Representation**:
  - Each node contains:
    - A left pointer.
    - A data value.
    - A right pointer.
  - `ROOT` points to the tree's root node. If `ROOT = NULL`, the tree is empty.

```c
struct node {
    struct node *left;
    int data;
    struct node *right;
};
```

### Binary Tree Traversal Techniques

#### **Traversal**: Visiting each node in the tree exactly once in a systematic order.

1. **Pre-order Traversal (Depth-First)**:
   - Visit root.
   - Traverse left subtree.
   - Traverse right subtree.
   - Example order: `A, B, C`.

2. **In-order Traversal (Symmetric)**:
   - Traverse left subtree.
   - Visit root.
   - Traverse right subtree.
   - Example order: `B, A, C`.

3. **Post-order Traversal**:
   - Traverse left subtree.
   - Traverse right subtree.
   - Visit root.
   - Example order: `B, C, A`.

4. **Level-order Traversal (Breadth-First)**:
   - Visit nodes level by level, left to right.
   - Example order: `A, B, C`.
